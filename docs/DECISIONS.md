# Decision log

Append new entries at the bottom. Format: number, date, decision, why, revisit-when.

## 1. Git-based publishing, no Supabase for content (2026-07-16)

**Decision:** Content flows Obsidian → Git → Vercel rebuild. Supabase is NOT part of the content pipeline.
**Why:** Markdown in git is already a versioned database; a DB sync layer would add webhooks, auth, and failure modes for ~1 minute of publish latency saved. An unused free-tier Supabase project would also auto-pause.
**Revisit when:** Dynamic features are needed (view counts, reactions, comments, AMA). Then add Supabase for those features only — content stays in git.

## 2. Vault root = repo root (2026-07-16)

**Decision:** The whole repo is opened as the Obsidian vault; content lives in `vault/`.
**Why:** The Obsidian Git plugin is most reliable when the git repo root is the vault root. Cost: code folders visible in Obsidian's explorer (harmless; excluded from search via settings).
**Revisit when:** Obsidian Git gains first-class support for vaults nested inside repos, or a two-repo split becomes worth it.

## 3. Images mirrored to public/ at build time (2026-07-16)

**Decision:** `scripts/sync-assets.mjs` copies non-md vault files to `public/vault-assets/` (prebuild/predev hook), instead of a runtime file-serving route.
**Why:** Keeps the site 100% static, works identically in dev/prod, no serverless file-tracing config.
**Revisit when:** Media volume makes the repo heavy (>~1 GB) — then move media to Supabase Storage or Vercel Blob.

## 4. Regex preprocessing for Obsidian syntax (2026-07-16)

**Decision:** `![[embeds]]` and `[[wiki links]]` are converted with regex before the unified pipeline, rather than a remark plugin.
**Why:** Two small, readable regexes vs. an AST plugin dependency. Wiki links resolve within the same section only.
**Revisit when:** Cross-section wiki links or embed transclusion (`![[Other Note]]` embedding note content) are needed.

## 5. Fully static generation, `dynamicParams = false` (2026-07-16)

**Decision:** Every route is pre-rendered at build; unknown paths 404 at the CDN.
**Why:** Fastest possible site, zero runtime dependencies, free tier friendly. Content only changes via git push anyway, which always triggers a rebuild.
**Revisit when:** Content volume makes builds slow (hundreds of posts) — then consider ISR.

## 6. Apple Music via free iframe embeds, not MusicKit (2026-07-16)

**Decision:** The `music` section type embeds playlists with `embed.music.apple.com` iframes (host swap of a normal share link). Section frontmatter is exposed as `section.meta` so types can read custom keys (`playlists:`).
**Why:** MusicKit/Apple Music API requires a paid Apple Developer account ($99/yr); iframe embeds are free, need no keys, and auto-match the visitor's light/dark theme. Brian Lovin's /listening (Spotify history sync) would need an API server + cron — out of scope for a static site.
**Revisit when:** Live "recently played" history is wanted — needs an API route + provider account (Spotify or MusicKit) + Supabase/KV for tokens.

## 7. Drawer sidebar hidden by default + emoji→SVG icon mapping (2026-07-17)

**Decision:** Sidebar starts hidden at every viewport size and slides in from a header menu button; the sticky header shows "<Section> · Kyrylo". Vault `icon:` frontmatter stays emoji-based, but known emoji are swapped for inline SVG icons at render time (`components/icons.tsx`), with unknown emoji rendering as-is.
**Why:** Owner preference (brianlovin-style minimal chrome). Mapping emoji→SVG keeps the Obsidian workflow unchanged — no new frontmatter syntax to learn — while the site gets crisp monochrome icons.
**Revisit when:** A persistent desktop sidebar is wanted again (restore from git history) or the icon set outgrows hand-drawn SVGs (consider lucide-react).

## 8. Fully static search, SEO, and feeds (2026-07-17)

**Decision:** Cmd+K search runs over a build-time JSON index passed as props (no backend, no client fetch). Sitemap/robots/RSS/OG images are all generated at build. OG images use `next/og` with the dark theme, no custom fonts.
**Why:** Keeps decision #1 (no runtime infrastructure) intact; the site is small enough that shipping the whole index in the HTML payload is cheap (capped at 1500 chars of plain text per page).
**Revisit when:** Content grows past ~100 entries — move the search index to a static JSON file fetched on first palette open, or a worker-based index (e.g. Pagefind).

## 10. Excalidraw via exported SVG, AI diagrams as self-theming SVG (2026-07-17)

**Decision:** `![[X.excalidraw]]` embeds resolve to the plugin's exported SVG (theme-aware when light+dark are exported), resolved vault-wide by name via `getAssetIndex()`. AI-generated diagrams are single self-theming SVG files (internal `prefers-color-scheme` styles), embedded like images. `.excalidraw.md` excluded from pages; `.excalidraw` JSON not shipped.
**Why:** Rendering live Excalidraw scenes needs the Excalidraw React app + canvas + fonts — too heavy for a static build. Exported SVG is identical, instant, and git-friendly. Self-theming SVG lets AI diagrams appear with no export step and adapt to the theme. Keeps decision #5 (fully static) intact.
**Revisit when:** Interactive/animated diagrams are wanted (embed an `.excalidraw.json` + client renderer), or a diagram needs to read live page CSS (use inline SVG instead of `<img>`).

## 9. AI content-intake workflow (2026-07-17)

**Decision:** Raw content → AI structures it into vault notes per `docs/CONTENT-WORKFLOW.md`. Policy chosen by the owner: light-touch editing (voice preserved), follow-up questions only when genuinely ambiguous, publish directly (no draft gate).
**Why:** The vault-as-CMS makes AI a natural editor: conventions are mechanical (frontmatter, templates, wiki links) while the writing stays human.
**Revisit when:** Mistakes reach production — flip the workflow's publishing rule to draft-first.

## 10. Apple Music embed: no sandbox + in-widget fallback link (2026-07-18)

**Decision:** The Apple Music embed iframe drops the custom `sandbox` attribute (matching Apple's official embed markup) and gets an in-widget "Open in Apple Music" footer link. Both render paths use the same card+footer look: the `music` section page renders it inline in `MusicList.tsx`; the markdown auto-embed (`appleMusicEmbedHtml`, styled via `.apple-music-*` classes in globals.css) mirrors it. Shared feature-policy string: `APPLE_MUSIC_IFRAME_ALLOW` in `lib/apple-music.ts`.
**Why:** The embed intermittently gets stuck on Apple's gray loading skeleton. The stall happens *after* the iframe's `load` event (which fires in ~200ms), inside Apple's cross-origin player JS, so a static site can't detect or auto-fix it. The `sandbox` was the one code-side variable that could block the third-party storage Apple's player needs to hydrate under strict privacy settings; removing it aligns with Apple's supported embed. A "Reload player" button was tried first but a remount doesn't reliably shake the stall loose, so it was dropped — the fallback link (always works) is the one dependable escape hatch.

**Stale-storage stall + the `credentialless` fix (2026-07-18):** The embed works in a fresh browser but stalls on the gray skeleton after repeated visits — confirmed by the owner: clearing `music.apple.com` cache + localStorage makes it work again. So the player chokes on first-party state it accumulates under apple.com, which our page can't clear cross-origin. Two things were tried:
- *Storage-isolating sandbox* (drop `allow-same-origin` → opaque origin, no storage): **rejected** — verified on production it leaves the player permanently gray. Apple's player needs same-origin storage to hydrate at all.
- *`credentialless` iframe attribute* (on both embed paths): **kept.** Chromium loads a credentialless iframe in a fresh, ephemeral storage partition every load — a "first visit" each time — while keeping the real origin (so the player still works, unlike the sandbox). No regression: Safari/Firefox ignore the attribute and behave as before. Gotcha: React 19 omits an unrecognized *boolean* attribute from the HTML, so it's passed as `credentialless=""` (string) on the JSX iframe and as a bare attribute in the markdown-pipeline HTML string; the JSX type is augmented in `types/iframe.d.ts`. Note: couldn't fully verify the runtime effect in-session (test browser was rate-limited by Apple after many reloads); it's a no-downside progressive enhancement, best confirmed on a clean Chromium profile.
**Revisit when:** Apple ships a reliable embed load/error event we can key an auto-retry on, the stalls stop, or `credentialless` turns out insufficient (then fall back to a click-to-load poster).
